/**
 * 
 * keep these facts and concepts in mind:
 * 
 * 1.Everything you can place in a variable is an object, and every object is a instance of class.
 *   Even numbers, functions, and null are objects. All objects inherit from Object class.
 * 
 * 2.Specifying static types(such as num in the preceding example) clarifies your intent and enables
 *   static checking by tools.(You might notice when you're debugging your code that variables with no
 *   special type: dynamic.) Specifying static types is optional in 1.x, however Dart is moving towards
 *   being a fully type safe language.
 * 
 * 3.In strong mode, static and runtime checks ensure that your code is type safe, helping you catch bugs
 *   in development, rather than at runtime. Strong mode is optional in Dart 1.x, but not optional in Dart 2.
 * 
 * 4.Dart parses all your code before running it.You can provide tips to Dart--for example, by using types
 *   or compile-time constants--to catch errors or help your code run faster.
 *
